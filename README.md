Blockchain is supposed to be available for anyone to mine and make money. You can buy a rig and run it at home, but you can’t earn a profit unless you have huge amount of capital or access to things like cheap electricty. Networks like Bitcoin are controlled by a small number of wealthy mining outfits. In Gladio is a blockchain where the miners play a game to mine the cryptocurrency. The idea is that anyone can play and earn money the whole time. If this reaches great success then it could suffice as basic income for some players.

The game is simple and you can play a match in a couple of minutes. It’s a fancy version of rock, paper scissors, but it’s a game that people are better at than computers. In Gladio is a gladiator game and you win by figuring out what moves the other player is going to make - using your intuition and the cards on the table. People are good at this, and it’s tough for computer AI to compete with us. To earn money you need to play well enough to prove you’re a person and not a bot. 

How much you earn depends on how well you compete. Each player has an Elo rating - a score - tracked on a leaderboard. If your Elo is high enough then you’ll earn Stake every time you play - and the higher your Elo to more you’ll earn. When you have enough Stake you can become a validator and earn Gladios - the currency of the game. 

In Gladio is a card game. Each match has two players and each player has eight cards played face up. Each card is a rock, paper or scissors - but they also have other aspects and abilities. The game last eight rounds of picking one card a round and trying to beat the other player or steal a treasure. With a multiple paths to victory, you have to predict your opponents moves while they predict yours. If you can out think them your cards will beat theirs and you’ll achieve victory. 

Anyone can join a random game that creates 17 new cards for free. Not all cards are equal and a random deck will have a mix of rarities. Each player gets 8 of them and the powerful 17th card is the prize for the winner. Some cards will be burned while playing, but even if you lose you will usually walk away with some new cards. These cards become the foundation of your card library.

For players who want to take control you can build your own decks of cards and use them in the advanced league. Using more powerful, but rarer cards you can choose strategies and greatly increase your odds of winning. You can build a library through playing random matches, or use Gladios to make the cards you want to play with.

Using Gladios to make new cards is what makes Gladios worth something. High scorers will earn enough Gladios to spend just some of them on making great decks. Rare cards cost more to produce, but many people may want to spend a little real money to build a few decks. This creates a supply side market for Gladios as ambitious players buy Gladios, create new decks and join the advanced league. Talented players who don’t want to spend will grind out random matches until they have the cards they need to join the advanced league.
